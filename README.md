### DATA 606 Final Project

**Study the Choice of Contraceptive Methods in Women**

In this project, I use statistical methods to study the relationship between the contraceptive method choice of a married woman in Indonesia and her demographic and socio-economic characteristics and then build a ML model to predict her choice.

And here I include the following files:

1. Data (cmc.data)
2. Final report (Xiang.pdf)
3. Final report with code (Xiang.Rmd)
